# 🐍 Snake Game 

This is a **simple text-based Snake game** developed using **pure Python**.  
The game runs in the **terminal/console** and helps beginners understand Python fundamentals such as lists, loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

## 📌 Game Description

- The snake moves on a **1–10 numbered board**
- The player controls the snake using keyboard inputs
- The goal is to **eat food** and increase the score
- The game ends if the snake moves outside the board

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
| `a` | Move Left |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
- No external libraries required

### 🧠 How the Game Works

* The snake starts at position 5
* Food appears randomly between 1 and 10
* Each move updates the snake’s position
* If the snake eats food:
   - Score increases
   - New food is generated
* If the snake goes outside the board:
   - Game Over
